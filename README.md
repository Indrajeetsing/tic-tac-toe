# Tic-Tac-Toe AI Challenge

Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe game where you play against an AI! This project is a simple yet engaging implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The AI opponent uses the Minimax algorithm to play optimally, making it a challenging opponent.

## Features

- Play against an AI opponent.
- AI uses the Minimax algorithm for optimal moves.
- Responsive design, looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Interactive and engaging UI with dynamic messages.
- Highlights the winning combination.

## How to Play

1. [Click here to play](https://raw.githack.com/Indrajeetsing/tic-tac-toe/main/ticTacToe.html)
2. Player X starts the game.
3. Click on an empty cell to make your move.
4. The AI will automatically make its move after you.
5. The game ends when there's a winner or the board is full (tie).

## Minimax Algorithm

The AI opponent is implemented using the Minimax algorithm, which ensures that it plays optimally. The algorithm evaluates all possible moves and chooses the one that maximizes the AI's chances of winning while minimizing the player's chances.

## Responsive Design

The game is designed to be responsive and looks good on both large screens and mobile devices. Font sizes and button sizes adjust based on the screen width to provide a pleasant user experience.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the game by modifying the styles or game logic. Contributions are welcome!
